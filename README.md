# CurvSeq / Physics-Informed-Spatial-Curvature-Sequencing-in-Prostate-Cancer

This repository hosts the code, data processing scripts, and visualization tools developed for the **CurvSeq** project ‚Äî a pipeline linking **glandular curvature**, **molecular expression**, **AFM-measured stiffness** in prostate adenocarcinoma tissues.

## üî¨ Overview

CurvSeq (short for *Curvature Sequencing*) provides a reproducible workflow to:
- Extract curvature metrics from segmented gland contours (QuPath, Cellpose-SAM, or manual masks)
- Visualize correlations between curvature and gene/protein data

## üíª System Requirements

| Component | Requirement | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Operating System** | Windows 10 or Windows 11 | Tested primarily on Windows 11 (64-bit) |
| **Python Version** | 3.10.x | Works best with Conda or venv environments |
| **RAM** | ‚â• 16 GB | Large TIFF/NumPy operations benefit from higher memory |
| **Storage** | ‚â• 50 GB free | Required for AFM exports, TIFF masks, and processed datasets |
| **GPU (optional)** | NVIDIA CUDA-enabled | Recommended for Cellpose-SAM acceleration |
|  **Dependencies** | Listed in `environment.yml` | Includes `numpy`, `scikit-image`, `tifffile`, `napari`, `scanpy`, `hdbscan`, `matplotlib`, and others |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage ‚Äì Computing Curvature

The curvature computation module extracts local curvature values from a gland boundary represented as a 2D curve.

### Input Format
The pipeline expects a **2D NumPy array** of shape `(N, 2)` representing the coordinates of the gland boundary:
```python
import numpy as np

# Example: a gland contour stored as (y, x) or (row, col)
coords = np.load("path/to/gland_boundary.npy")  # shape (N, 2)
```
## AnnData Input
When integrating molecular or intensity data, the pipeline accepts an AnnData (.h5ad) file that stores spatial transcriptomics or imaging-derived intensity features for each observation.

Typical format:
AnnData object with n_obs √ó n_vars = 71380 √ó 2
obs: 'X', 'Y',

Where X and Y are the cell coordinates, the vars are the genes of interest
