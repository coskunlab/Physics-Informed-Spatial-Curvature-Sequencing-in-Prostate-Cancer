# CurvSeq / Physics-Informed-Spatial-Curvature-Sequencing-in-Prostate-Cancer

This repository hosts the code, data processing scripts, and visualization tools developed for the **CurvSeq** project ‚Äî a pipeline linking **glandular curvature**, **molecular expression**, **AFM-measured stiffness** in prostate adenocarcinoma tissues.

## üî¨ Overview

CurvSeq (short for *Curvature Sequencing*) provides a reproducible workflow to:
- Extract curvature metrics from segmented gland contours (QuPath, Cellpose-SAM, or manual masks)
- Visualize correlations between curvature and gene/protein data

## üíª System Requirements

| Component | Requirement | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Operating System** | Windows 10 or Windows 11 | Tested primarily on Windows 11 (64-bit) |
| **Python Version** | 3.10.x | Works best with Conda or venv environments |
| **RAM** | ‚â• 16 GB | Large TIFF/NumPy operations benefit from higher memory |
