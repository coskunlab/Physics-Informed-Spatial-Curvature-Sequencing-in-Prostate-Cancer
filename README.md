## üî¨ Overview

CurvSeq (short for *Curvature Sequencing*) provides a reproducible workflow to:
- Extract curvature metrics from segmented gland contours (QuPath, Cellpose-SAM, or manual masks)
- Visualize correlations between curvature and gene/protein data

The following images show the main pipeline of CurvSeq/CurvSee

This schematic illustrates the overall CurvSeq/CurvSee workflow. Starting from multiplexed prostate tissue images (step 1), gland boundaries are extracted and used to compute local curvature profiles (step 2). These curvature values‚Äîdistinguishing outward and inward regions‚Äîare then projected onto the corresponding molecular maps derived from spatial transcriptomics or proteomics data (step 3). Finally, curvature metrics are correlated with gene or protein expression levels to reveal spatial mechano-molecular relationships within prostate gland architecture (step 4).

This figure demonstrates an example application of the CurvSeq workflow. The top panels show the computed curvature along a gland boundary (left) and the corresponding spatial distribution of FOXA1 expression (right). The bottom panels display microniche segmentation based on curvature and expression similarity, followed by correlation analysis between curvature and FOXA1 levels. A positive Pearson correlation indicates that higher gland curvature regions are associated with elevated FOXA1 expression, highlighting spatial mechano-molecular coupling within the tissue.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
This repository includes two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the main steps of the CurvSeq pipeline:

-**Compute_curvature_contours.ipynb** ‚Äî shows how to load gland boundary coordinates, compute local curvature values, and visualize curvature profiles along each contour.

-**Compute_plot_gene_curvature_correlation.ipynb** ‚Äî demonstrates how to merge curvature data with molecular or protein expression (from AnnData files) and perform statistical correlation analysis (Pearson/Spearman), including visualizations of curvature‚Äìexpression relationships.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage ‚Äì Computing Curvature

The curvature computation module extracts local curvature values from a gland boundary represented as a 2D curve.

### Input Format
The pipeline expects a **2D NumPy array** of shape `(N, 2)` representing the coordinates of the gland boundary:
```python
import numpy as np

# Example: a gland contour stored as (y, x) or (row, col)
coords = np.load("path/to/gland_boundary.npy")  # shape (N, 2)
```
## AnnData Input
When integrating molecular or intensity data, the pipeline accepts an AnnData (.h5ad) file that stores spatial transcriptomics or imaging-derived intensity features for each observation.

```python
Typical format:
AnnData object with n_obs √ó n_vars = 71380 √ó 2
obs: 'X', 'Y',
```
Where X and Y are the cell coordinates, the vars are the genes of interest
