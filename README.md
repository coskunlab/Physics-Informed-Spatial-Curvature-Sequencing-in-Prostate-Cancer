# CurvSeq / Physics-Informed-Spatial-Curvature-Sequencing-in-Prostate-Cancer

This repository hosts the code, data processing scripts, and visualization tools developed for the **CurvSeq** project — a pipeline linking **glandular curvature**, **molecular expression**, **AFM-measured stiffness** in prostate adenocarcinoma tissues.

## 🔬 Overview

CurvSeq (short for *Curvature Sequencing*) provides a reproducible workflow to:
- Extract curvature metrics from segmented gland contours (QuPath, Cellpose-SAM, or manual masks)
- Visualize correlations between curvature and gene/protein data
